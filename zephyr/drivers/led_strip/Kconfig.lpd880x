	  Enable LED strip driver for daisy chains of LPD880x
	  (LPD8803, LPD8806, or compatible) devices.

	  Each LPD880x LED driver chip has some output channels
	  (3 channels for LPD8803, 6 for LPD8806), whose PWM
	  duty cycle can be set at 7 bit resolution via a
	  reduced SPI interface (MOSI and CLK lines only).
	  Each chip also includes data and clock out pins for
	  daisy chaining LED strips.

	select STREAM_FLASH_ERASE
	help
	  If enabled, flash is erased as necessary when receiving new firmware,

	  times at the beginning of the DFU process.

config IMG_ENABLE_IMAGE_CHECK

	select FLASH_AREA_CHECK_INTEGRITY
	help
	  If enabled, there will be available the function to check flash
	  integrity.  It can be used to verify flash integrity after received
	  a new firmware.  This is useful to avoid firmware reboot and test.
	  Another use is to ensure that firmware upgrade routines from internet
	  server to flash slot are performing properly.

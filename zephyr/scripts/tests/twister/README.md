# Twister Testing

Running the tests require the environment variable ZEPHYR_BASE to be set.

Twister Testsuite are located in $ZEPHYR_BASE/scripts/tests directory with all the data files in $ZEPHYR_BASE/scripts/test_data directory.

## Dependencies

Install all the dependencies using

```
pip install -r $ZEPHYR_BASE/scripts/requirements-build-test.txt
```

## Executing testsuite

The testcases can be executed from the root directory using

```
pytest $ZEPHYR_BASE/scripts/tests/twister
```

## Twister Coverage

The coverage for all the tests can be run using the command below. This will collect all the tests available.

```bash
coverage run -m pytest $ZEPHYR_BASE/scripts/tests/twister/
```

Then we can generate the coverage report for just twister script using

```bash
coverage report -m $ZEPHYR_BASE/scripts/pylib/twister/twisterlib.py
```

To generate the coverage report for twister script use below command

```bash
coverage report -m $ZEPHYR_BASE/scripts/twister
```

The html coverage report for twister can be generated using

```bash
coverage html twister
```

If needed,the full coverage html report can be generated in every run of "pytest" in the tests directory using configuration file (setup.cfg).

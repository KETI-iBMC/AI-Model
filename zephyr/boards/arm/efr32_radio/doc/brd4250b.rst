for details of the configuration and common features supported by the
efr32_radio_brd4250b board.

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:

	``boards/arm/efr32_radio/efr32_radio_brd4250b_defconfig``

System Clock
============

The EFR32FG1P SoC is configured to use the 38.4 MHz external oscillator on the
board.

Serial Port
===========

The EFR32FG1P SoC has two USARTs and one Low Energy UARTs (LEUART).
USART0 is connected to the board controller and is used for the console.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Please refer to
:ref:`Programming and Debugging EFR32 Radio Board <efr32_radio_programming>`
for details on the supported debug interfaces.

Flashing
========

Connect the BRD4001A board with a mounted BRD4250B radio module to your host
computer using the USB port.

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: efr32_radio_brd4250b
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc.) with the following settings:

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Reset the board and you should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

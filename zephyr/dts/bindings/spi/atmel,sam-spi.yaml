        PIO pin configuration for the various SPI signals that includes
        MISO, MOSI, SPCK, and possibly various chip selects signals.  We
        expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These
        nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines
        and be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

        For example the SPI on SAME7x would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pd20b_spi0_miso &pd21b_spi0_mosi &pd22b_spi0_spck>;

  Test binding for 3 levels of "child-binding".

  Previous versions of Zephyr only allowed up to two levels of
  "child-binding:" in a YAML file. This file is used to test that the
  restriction no longer holds.

compatible: "vnd,great-grandchild-bindings"

include: [base.yaml]

child-binding:
  description: child node, no properties

  child-binding:
    description: grandchild node, no properties

    child-binding:
      description: great-grandchild node, ggc-prop property

      properties:
        ggc-prop:
          type: int
          required: true

    center-aligned:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Set this to use center-aligned (up and down) counter mode.

    ch0-pin:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        The channel 0 pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for channel 0, set:

            ch0-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for channel 0, set:

            ch0-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

    ch0-inverted:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Set this to invert channel 0.

    ch1-pin:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        The channel 1 pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same
        as the ch0-pin property's.

    ch1-inverted:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Set this to invert channel 1.

    ch2-pin:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        The channel 2 pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same
        as the ch0-pin property's.

    ch2-inverted:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Set this to invert channel 2.

    ch3-pin:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        The channel 3 pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same
        as the ch0-pin property's.

    ch3-inverted:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: Set this to invert channel 3.

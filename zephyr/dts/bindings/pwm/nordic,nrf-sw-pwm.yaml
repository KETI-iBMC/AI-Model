        Reference to TIMER or RTC instance for generating PWM output signals
      required: false

    timer-instance:
      type: int
      description: |
        Timer instance to use for generating the PWM output signals. Deprecated
        in favour of 'generator' property.

    channel-count:
      type: int
      description: |
        Number of PWM channels. Limited by RTC/TIMER instance compare registers
        minus 1.
      required: true

    clock-prescaler:
      type: int
      description: |
        Clock prescaler for RTC or TIMER used for generating PWM output signals.

        RTC: needs to be set to 0, which gives 32768 Hz base clock for PWM
        generation.

        TIMER: 16 MHz / 2^prescaler base clock is used for PWM generation.
      required: true

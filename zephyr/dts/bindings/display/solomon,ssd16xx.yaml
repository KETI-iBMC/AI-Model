      description: DC pin.

        The DC pin of SSD16XX is active low (transmission command byte).
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

    busy-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: BUSY pin.

        The BUSY pin of SSD16XX is active high.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active high.

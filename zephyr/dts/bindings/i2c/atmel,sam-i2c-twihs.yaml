        PIO pin configuration for TWCK & TWD signals.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

        For example the I2C on SAME7x would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa4a_twihs0_twck0 &pa3a_twihs0_twd0>;

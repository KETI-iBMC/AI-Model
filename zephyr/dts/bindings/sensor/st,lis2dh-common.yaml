      description: Indicates the device driver should disconnect SDO/SA0 pull-up
                   during device initialization (e.g. to save current
                   leakage). Note that only subset of devices supported by this
                   binding have SDO/SA0 pull-up (e.g. LIS2DH12, LIS3DH).

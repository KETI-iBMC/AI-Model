    GPIO pins exposed on Adafruit Feather headers.

    The Feather layout provides two headers, one each along
    opposite edges of the board.
    Proceeding counter-clockwise:
    * A 16-pin header.  12 pins on this header are exposed
      by this binding.
    * A 12-pin header.  9 pins on this header are exposed
      by this binding.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 21 pins where parent pins 0
    through 5 correspond to A0 through A5, and parent pins 6 through 20
    correspond as depicted below:

        - RESET
        - 3V3
        - 3V3
        - GND
        0 A0                     - VBAT
        1 A1                     - EN
        2 A2                     - VBUS
        3 A3                     D13  20
        4 A4                     D12  19
        5 A5                     D11  18
        6 SCK                    D10  17
        7 MOSI                   D9   16
        8 MISO                   D6   15
        9 RX                     D5   14
       10 TX                     SCL  13
       11 D4                     SDA  12

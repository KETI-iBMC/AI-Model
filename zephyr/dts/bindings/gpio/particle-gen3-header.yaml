    GPIO pins exposed on Particle Gen3 (Feather) headers.

    The Particle Gen3 boards are compatible with the Adafruit Feather
    "shields" but use a different orientation and pin numbering scheme.

    With the board oriented with the micro USB at the top:
    * A 12-pin header on the right.  9 pins on this header are exposed
      by this binding
    * A 16-pin header.  13 pins on this header are exposed by this
      binding.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 22 pins where parent pins
    0 through 8 correspond to the pins on the 12-pin header, starting
    from the bottom; and pins 9 through 21 correspond to pins on the
    16-pin header, skipping the bottom pin then assigning 9 through 19,
    skipping over GND, and replacing the lower 3V3 with pin 20.  The
    physical layout is depicted below.
